I want to build an inventory management system for hospital supplies. This will be an enterprise level web application.

To ensure a structured and organized development process, I propose we begin with comprehensive planning. Let's create a detailed project plan document categorized by key development areas.

Each category will serve as a milestone checkpoint, allowing for review and refinement before proceeding to subsequent phases. This iterative approach will help maintain quality and alignment with requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

# Authentication & Security
1. Implement secure authentication using email/password with JWT tokens
2. Multi-tenant architecture with isolated company databases to ensure data segregation

# Core Functionality Requirements
1. Item Classification
   - Two primary categories: Medications and Supply Items
   - Medication safety classifications:
     - Hazardous
     - High Alert
     - LASA (Look-Alike-Sound-Alike)

2. Medication Data Structure
   - Unique identifier
   - Name
   - Drug identifier
   - Additional fields as required

3. Inventory Organization
   - Hierarchical structure: Site > Stock Area > Items
   - Comprehensive stock area and site management
   - Inventory tracking metrics:
     - Current quantity
     - Maximum capacity
     - Reorder threshold

4. Item Detail Interface
   - Tabbed interface including:
     - General Information
     - Inventory Status
     - Subscription Management
       - Site and stock area allocation
       - Location-specific quantity settings
   - Sequential navigation with filter persistence

   - React component architecture
   - Tanstack React Table implementation:
     - Advanced filtering
     - Column sorting
     - Pagination
     - Global search functionality
   - Theming:
     - Dark mode default
     - Light mode option
     - Primary accent color: #46b555
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

3. Backend Development
